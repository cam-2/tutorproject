## Application Description
This application pairs tutors and students up based on multiple factors. Users can register a student or tutor account, which have different properties.  
Tutors register information such as:
- Comfortable subjects
- Level of expertise
- Modality
- General location
- Available times
- Cost per session  

Student users can query for tutors based on these criteria.   
Once a student finds a tutor, the application provides the tutorâ€™s email address for coordination. Based on their communication, a time and date is selected, and the application updates to show that time as unavailable for other students.
